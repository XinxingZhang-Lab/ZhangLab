Weiwei is a visiting scholar for the Zhang lab and is currently studying for his master's degree in Huazhong Agricultural University. He has participated in multiple projects including a nematode temperature-related experiment, from which he has learned that you can not only excercise independent thinking but also experience the joy of exploration. Outside of work, Weiwei likes to play basketball, guitar, and table tennis.
