Weiwei is a  former visiting scholar for the Zhang lab and who is currently studying for his master's degree in Huazhong Agricultural University. He  participated in multiple projects including a nematode temperature-related experiment, from which he  learned that you can not only excercise independent thinking but also experience the joy of exploration. Weiwei was an extremly vital member of this lab. We wish him the best of luck with his studies and can't wait to see what he does next!
