My name is Deng Jundan, currently serving as a visiting scholar at the University of Oklahoma Health Science Center (OUHSC). During my Ph.D. studies at Anhui Agricultural University in Anhui Province, China, I specialized in investigating the immune system of Monochamus alternatus(pine sawyer beetle) and the response of its symbiotic bacteria to entomopathogenic fungi. At OUHSC, my research now focuses on exploring how Caenorhabditis elegans (nematode) responds to environmental stimuli, particularly at the molecular and cellular levels.  
Outside of academia, I enjoy traveling to immerse myself in natural landscapes, creating handmade crafts and desserts, and unwinding with video games. These hobbies not only balance my scientific pursuits but also inspire creativity in my research approach.
