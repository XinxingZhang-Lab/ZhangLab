Yuling is a Postdoctoral researcher in the Zhang lab. She earned her PhD in Molecular Biology and Biochemistry from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in September 2023. During her doctoral research, Yuling explored the interaction between environmental factors and aging, focusing on the underlying mechanisms using the model organism *C. elegans*. Her primary research interest was in how cinnamon influences lifespan. Fascinated by these tiny worms, Yuling decided to continue exploring the sensory world after completing her PhD. Outside of her academic work, Yuling enjoys electronic gaming, watching classical movies, and tasting various kinds of food!
