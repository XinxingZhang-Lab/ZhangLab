The Zhang Lab had an exciting opportunity to attend the 2025 International C. elegans Meeting, a global gathering of worm researchers and enthusiasts! From cutting-edge discoveries in neural circuits and behavior to groundbreaking advances in gene editing and metabolism, the conference was packed with inspiring talks and innovative poster sessions.

Our team was thrilled to see how the field of C. elegans research continues to thrive and evolve. We connected with fellow scientists, learned about the latest tools and technologies, and gained fresh perspectives to fuel our own projects.

It was an energizing and insightful experience—and a great reminder of the vibrant and collaborative spirit that drives the worm community. We’re coming back with new ideas, new connections, and renewed excitement for science!

Here’s to more meetings, more worms, and more discovery ahead!
