This summer, the Zhang Lab was honored to host Jaxon through the Native American Research Centers for Health (NARCH) program. Over the course of the project, Jaxon immersed himself in hands-on research, learned new techniques, and contributed meaningfully to our ongoing studies.

To cap off his experience, Jaxon delivered a fantastic poster presentation, sharing his findings, insights, and reflections with the lab. His clear explanations, thoughtful discussion, and enthusiasm for science truly impressed everyone!

We’re so proud of his hard work and growth, and we hope this summer gave him a fun and fulfilling scientific experience. Congratulations, Jaxon—and we wish you all the best in your future endeavors!
