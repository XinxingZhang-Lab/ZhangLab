The Zhang Lab is thrilled to welcome Oliver Rubin, who officially starts his rotation in the lab! 

We’re so excited to have him join our little science family. Oliver brings fresh curiosity, great energy, and a big smile — the perfect combo for diving into experiments.

We hope he enjoys exploring new techniques, learning cool stuff, and discovering how fun (and sometimes chaotic) lab life can be! Here’s to a rotation full of discoveries, laughter, and maybe a few too many coffee breaks!
