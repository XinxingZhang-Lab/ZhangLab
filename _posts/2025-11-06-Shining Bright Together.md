The weather may be getting colder, but the Zhang Lab’s warmth and energy are as strong as ever!

We recently took a lovely group photo against a beautiful backdrop — a perfect reminder that even as the seasons change, our team spirit shines bright.

Just like the stars we posed as in the photo, we hope everyone in the lab continues to sparkle in their own way — whether it’s through new discoveries, creative ideas, or the laughter we share every day.
