We would like to welcome one of our newest members of the Zhang Lab, Jundan Deng! Before joining the lab, Jundan spent her PhD studies at Anhui Agricultural University where she specialized in investigating the immune system of *Monochamus alternatus* and the response of its symbiotic bacteria to entomopathogenic fungi. We are excited to have her as a part of the lab and can't wait to see what she accomplishes!!
